# M√∂bius Strip Parametric Modeling üåê

This project models a M√∂bius strip using parametric equations, approximates its **surface area** and **edge length**, and provides a 3D visualization using `matplotlib`.

Developed and tested in **Google Colab**, with both `.ipynb` and `.py` versions available in this repository.

## üìê Parametric Equations

The M√∂bius strip is constructed using the equations:
- `x(u,v)` = (R + v * cos(u / 2)) * cos(u)
- `y(u,v)`= (R + v * cos(u / 2)) * sin(u)
- `z(u,v)` = v * sin(u / 2)
Where:
- `u` ‚àà `[0, 2œÄ]`
- `v` ‚àà `[-w/2, w/2]`
- `R`: Radius (centerline of the strip)
- `w`: Width of the strip

## üß± Code Structure

The `MobiusStrip` class provides:

- **Mesh generation** using parametric equations
- **Surface area** approximation using numerical gradients and cross products
- **Edge length** computation via discrete Euclidean distances
- **3D visualization** with `matplotlib`

## üìä Surface Area Approximation

We use numerical integration via finite differences:

1. Compute partial derivatives of X, Y, Z over `u` and `v` using `np.gradient`.
2. Calculate the cross product to obtain surface normals.
3. The norm of each normal gives a differential area element `dA`.
4. Sum all `dA` over the mesh to approximate total area.

## üìè Edge Length Computation

Two edge curves (`v = -w/2` and `v = +w/2`) are sampled.

- For each boundary curve, distances between adjacent points are calculated.
- The total edge length is the sum of these segment lengths.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualization

- 3D surface plot via `matplotlib` (`plot_surface`)
- Uses `viridis` colormap with shading and smooth interpolation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **Handling M√∂bius Topology in Parametrization**  
  The M√∂bius strip has a non-orientable surface with a half-twist, which makes defining a consistent 3D mesh difficult. Special care was needed near the seam (`u = 0` and `u = 2œÄ`) to avoid discontinuities.

- **Numerical Gradient Instability at Edges**  
  Approximating the surface area required computing partial derivatives using finite differences. These gradients can become unstable near the boundaries or areas with high curvature, impacting accuracy.

- **Edge Interpolation Precision**  
  Calculating the edge length along the boundary curves involved careful interpolation along a non-trivial path, as the M√∂bius strip flips once and wraps around itself.

- **Balancing Resolution vs. Performance in Colab**  
  Higher resolution (`n`) improves surface smoothness and measurement accuracy but increases compute time and memory usage. Finding a balance that works well in Google Colab was necessary.

- **Visualization Issues with Overlapping Geometry**  
  The twisted nature of the M√∂bius strip can cause overlapping or occluded parts in the 3D plot. Adjustments to transparency (`alpha`) and color mapping helped make the visualization clearer.
